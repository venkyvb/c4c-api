## Cloud for Customer API Examples

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PASE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**Note this is not an offical repository from SAP Cloud for customer**. 

This repository is an attempt to provide a set of sample payloads for SAP Cloud for customer OData APIs. You can use these payloads to bootstrap your project. 

###Overview

####OData versions
If you are new to OData protocol in general it is recommended that you go to http://www.odata.org/ to read and understand the basic aspects of this protocol. SAP Cloud for customer, specifically, supports the V2.0 of the OData protocol, you can read about the version specific aspects [here](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/).


####OData service catalog
You can use the OData Service Catalog https://myNNNNNN.crm.ondemand.com/sap/c4c/odata/v1/odataservicecatalog/ODataServiceCollection, available in your C4C tenant, to get a list of all services that are available for usage. This service would return both the SAP shipped standard OData services as well as the custom services that you may have modeled in your tenant using the OData Service Explorer (for more details around the OData Service Explorer, please refer to the Cloud for customer product documentation).
